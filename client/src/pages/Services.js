          Here in Kamalayan Therapy Services Inc., we believe in utilising
          evidence-based practices in helping our client manage their own
          concerns and give them the necessary tools and skills in managing
          their own issues. Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an approach to care
          that integrates the best available research evidence with clinical
          expertise and client values. It involves translating evidence into
          practice, also known as knowledge translation, and ensuring that
          ‘stakeholders (health practitioners, clients, family and carers) are
          aware of and use research evidence to inform their health and
          healthcare decision-making’.

          Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological
          treatment that has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of
          problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use
          problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental
          illness. Numerous research studies suggest that CBT leads to
          significant improvement in functioning and quality of life. In many
          studies, CBT has been demonstrated to be as effective as, or more
          effective than, other forms of psychological therapy or psychiatric
          medications.

          <li>
            Learning to recognize one’s distortions in thinking that are

          </li>
          <li>
            Gaining a better understanding of the behavior and motivation of
            others.

            Using problem-solving skills to cope with difficult situations.

          <li>
            Learning to develop a greater sense of confidence in one’s own
            abilities.

        <p>
          Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a modified type of cognitive
          behavioral therapy (CBT). Its main goals are to teach people how to
          live in the moment, develop healthy ways to cope with stress, regulate
          their emotions, and improve their relationships with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          DBT was originally intended to treat borderline personality disorder
          (BPD), but it has been adapted to treat other mental health
          conditions. It can help people who have difficulty with emotional
          regulation or are exhibiting self-destructive behaviors (such as
          eating disorders and substance use disorders).
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of therapy is also sometimes used to treat post-traumatic
          stress disorder (PTSD).

        <p>
          Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an action-oriented approach
          to psychotherapy that stems from traditional behavior therapy and
          cognitive behavioral therapy. Clients learn to stop avoiding, denying,
          and struggling with their inner emotions and, instead, accept that
          these deeper feelings are appropriate responses to certain situations
          that should not prevent them from moving forward in their lives. With
          this understanding, clients begin to accept their hardships and commit
          to making necessary changes in their behavior, regardless of what is
          going on in their lives and how they feel about it.

        <p>
          Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) is a short-term goal-focused
          evidence-based therapeutic approach, which incorporates positive
          psychology principles and practices, and which helps clients change by
          constructing solutions rather than focusing on problems. In the most
          basic sense, SFBT is a hope friendly, positive emotion eliciting,
          future-oriented vehicle for formulating, motivating, achieving, and
          sustaining desired behavioral change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution-Focused practitioners develop solutions by first generating a
          detailed description of how the client’s life will be different when
          the problem is gone or their situation improved to a degree
          satisfactory to the client. Therapist and client then carefully search
          through the client’s life experience and behavioral repertoire to
          discover the necessary resources needed to co-construct a practical
          and sustainable solution that the client can readily implement.
          Typically this process involves identifying and exploring previous
          “exceptions,” e.g. times when the client has successfully coped with
          or addressed previous difficulties and challenges. In an inherently
          respectful and practical interview process, SF therapists and their
          clients consistently collaborate in identifying goals reflective of
          clients’ best hopes and developing satisfying solutions.

        <p>
          Narrative therapy seeks to be a respectful, non-blaming approach to
          counselling and community work, which centres people as the experts in
          their own lives. It views problems as separate from people and assumes
          people have many skills, competencies, beliefs, values, commitments
          and abilities that will assist them to reduce the influence of
          problems in their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are various principles which inform narrative ways of working,
          but in my opinion, two are particularly significant: always
          maintaining a stance of curiosity, and always asking questions to
          which you genuinely do not know the answers. I invite you to read this
          book with these two principles in mind. They inform the ideas, the
          stance, the tone, the values, the commitments and the beliefs of
          narrative therapy.

          Play therapy is a powerful means of joining with the innate, creative,
          non-verbal capacities of children in order to engage and work
          therapeutically with them. It is a developmentally appropriate,
          evidence-based method of counselling younger clients. In play therapy,
          children can play out, literally and/or metaphorically, their inner
          and real life experiences in a way that builds insight and capacity.
          Play therapy allows children to express, regulate, communicate,
          practice and master new skills as well as their emotional responses.

          Imago relationship therapy (IRT) aims to equip couples with the tools
          necessary to relate to each other in healthier ways, and reveal the
          emotional pathway formed in childhood that led them to their current
          situation. This form of therapy combines spiritual and behavioral
          techniques with Western psychological methodologies in order to assist
          couples in unveiling their unconscious components. Imago relationship
          therapy involves viewing a conflict between couples as merely the
          outcome of specific circumstances—not the cause of disharmony. By
          examining the conflict itself, a couple can arrive at a satisfying
          solution, heal, and then grow together.

          <strong>Individual therapy</strong> is a joint process between a
          therapist and a person in therapy. Common goals of therapy can be to
          inspire change or improve quality of life. People may seek therapy for
          help with issues that are hard to face alone. Individual therapy is
          also called therapy, psychotherapy, psychosocial therapy, talk
          therapy, and counseling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therapy can help people overcome obstacles to their well-being. It can
          increase positive feelings, such as compassion and self-esteem. People
          in therapy can learn skills for handling difficult situations, making
          healthy decisions, and reaching goals. Many find they enjoy the
          therapeutic journey of becoming more self-aware. Some people even go
          to ongoing therapy for self-growth.

          Group therapy means more than one individual is being treated at the
          same time by at least one therapist. Some groups may have more than
          one therapist. Group sizes vary depending on the type of therapy. For
          instance, couples therapy, a type of group therapy that typically
          treats romantic partners, consists of two individuals; whereas, other
          groups, such as substance misuse groups, may include 10 to 12 people
          in one session. Researchers who study the effectiveness of group
          therapy generally recommend 6 to 12 individuals in a group.

          Couples therapy is a type of psychotherapy in which a therapist with
          clinical experience working with couples, helps people involved in a
          romantic relationship gain insight into their relationship, resolve
          conflict, and improve relationship satisfaction utilising a variety of
          therapeutic interventions. Although the practice of behavioral couples
          therapy may vary depending on the therapist’s theoretical orientation,
          all couples therapy tends to involve the following general elements:
        </p>

            A focus on a specific problem (i.e. sexual difficulties, Internet

          <li>
            Active participation on the part of the therapist in treating the
            relationship itself, rather than each individual separately.

          Social skills groups are small groups (typically two to eight kids)
          led by an adult who teaches the kids how to interact appropriately
          with others their age. They can help kids learn conversational,
          friendship, and problem-solving skills. They can also be useful in
          teaching kids to control their emotions and understand other people’s
          perspectives.
